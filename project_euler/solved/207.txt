ALGEBRA

Solution of equation is:

2^t = (1+sqrt(1+4*k)) / 2 = z (let)

We want ratio P(m) = a/b, where for all k <= m
b = number of k for which z is integer
a = number of k for which z is a power of 2

let, r = 1/12345

quick calculation shows that for when a = 18, the ratio crosses r
thus, a = 17, therefore b for which P(m) is just below r is
b = 17 * 12345 + 1 = 209866

the value of m can be calculated by b:
m = ((2*b+2-1)**2-1)/4
