RECIPROCAL DIOPHANTINE EQUATION

Since x,y>n, we put x=n+a, y=n+b. Solving, it gives n^2=a*b.
The number of (x,y) will be distinct pairs of (a,b).
If n has a prime factorization p1^a1 * p2^a2 * p3^a3 ...
then, n^2 has number of divisors (2*a1+1)*(2*a2+1)*(2*a3+1)*... = d (let)
which gives number of pairs (a,b) as 2*d-1

So problem is to find minimum n such that 2*d-1>1000.
The number of distinct primes that are required is < 7 because 3^7=2187. Now, one can try combinations for 6 primes and again for less primes. A simple n-tuple generator can produce all combinations and easily yield the minimum n.
