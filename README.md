This code repository hosts my solutions to programming puzzles and problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com) and [RoseCode](https://rosecode.neocities.org/).

### WARNING: THESE CODE FILES ARE NOT INTENDED TO OBTAIN ANSWERS FOR SUBMISSION WITHOUT SOLVING THE PROBLEMS YOURSELF.

**Project Euler**: I have mostly been active in solving Project Euler problems, my username is *udy11* and my current status is:

![Level-8](https://projecteuler.net/profile/udy11.png)

Project Euler suggests its users to not publish solutions for problems beyond first 100. So, solutions of problems 100+ have been archived in a password-protected file in [project_euler](project_euler) folder, whose password can be requested from me if you only want to see my codes for any purpose other than using them to submit answers on Project Euler. In the [folder](project_euler), solutions of first 100 problems can be found, but since they were written when I had barely started learning to program, my solutions might not be good and codes might not be well written.

**Advent of Code**: I very recently started solving problems here and hope to catch up soon.

**CodeChef**: I only tried few problems several years ago and might start it again some time. You can check my profile [here](https://www.codechef.com/users/shn11).

**RoseCode**: Status similar to CodeChef, I might try it some time.
